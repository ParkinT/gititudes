Gititudes
=========

While creating ["Mastering Git"]() for [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com), I made the realization that git consistently exhibits these consistent behaviors; the **attitudes** git exhibits.
Inspired by The Bible and what is referred to as "The Beatitudes", I developed this list of [Gititudes](http://www.gititude.com).

  - git **never** forgets
  - git remembers only *changes* in files, and not merely files
  - git will only commit changes in the index; not all changes in the working directory
  - git tries **really hard** to protect you from making horrible mistakes
  - git offers the capability to *craft* a history as YOU WANT IT TO BE (regardless of 'the real' historical activity)
