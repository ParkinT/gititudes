Gititudes
=========

While creating ["Mastering Git"](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-git-video) for [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com), I made the realization that git consistently exhibits these behaviors; the **attitudes** git exhibits.
Inspired by The Bible and what is referred to as "The Beatitudes", I developed this list of [Gititudes](http://www.gititudes.com).

  - git **never** forgets
  - git remembers only *changes* in files, and not [merely] entire files
  - git will only commit changes in the index; not all changes in the working directory
  - git tries **really hard** to protect you from making horrible mistakes
  - git offers the capability to *craft* a history as YOU WANT IT TO BE (regardless of 'the real' chronological flow of activity)
